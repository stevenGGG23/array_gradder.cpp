This project is a Grade Calculator Program written in C++. It reads a list of student grades from a file, processes them to compute the total points earned, and calculates the final grade percentage as well as the corresponding letter grade.

Key Features:
File Input: The program prompts the user to input the name of a text file containing up to 30 grades. It handles errors if the file cannot be opened.
Array Usage: Grades are stored in a fixed-size array (up to 30 elements), which is processed to calculate the total points and final grade.
Grade Calculation:
It calculates the total points earned by summing up the grades.
It computes the final grade as a percentage of the total possible points (where each grade is out of 100).
The program then assigns a letter grade based on standard grading criteria.
Formatted Output: Results, including the number of grades, total points earned, maximum possible points, final grade percentage, and letter grade, are displayed in a neatly formatted output.
This project demonstrates file handling, basic input/output, arrays, and grade calculation logic. It is useful for automating the calculation of grades based on student performance.
